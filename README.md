# Megatrend corporate site

Bilingual (English / Vietnamese) B2B marketing site for Megatrend, built with Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and next-intl.
All content pages are statically generated; the only server code is the contact-form API, which emails leads through Resend.

- 17 routes under `/en` and `/vi`: home, about, partners, news, jobs, segments, solutions, projects (list + detail where applicable), contact, privacy policy, cookies, HTML sitemap.
- Content lives in `/content` (MDX + JSON) and is validated with Zod at build and check time.
- No database, no login, no third-party CAPTCHA. Leads are only sent by email.

## Getting started

Requirements: Node.js 20.9 or later (developed on Node 24), npm.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional in development
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:3000 → redirects to /en
```

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Development server |
| `npm run build` / `npm run start` | Production build (static generation) and server |
| `npm run check` | ESLint + `next typegen` + `tsc --noEmit` + content check. Runs in CI on every pull request |
| `npm run content:check` | Validates every record in `/content` (schema, images, alt text, cross references) and that `messages/en.json` and `vi.json` have the same keys. Add `-- --unused` to list images not referenced by content |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright smoke tests. Starts its own `next dev` on port 3300, so stop any other dev server for this project first. First run: `npx playwright install chromium` |
| `npm run images:optimize` | Converts new photos in `public/images` to WebP (max 1920 px, under 300 KB). Run after adding photos |

## Environment variables

Set them in `.env.local` locally and in the Vercel project settings for Preview and Production. See `.env.example`.

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Production | Resend API key. Without it (or without `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL`) the contact API logs the lead on the server and reports success in development, and returns a clear "not configured" error (HTTP 503) in production |
| `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` | Production | Inbox that receives leads. Required: the site shows no public email |
| `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL` | Production | Sender, e.g. `Megatrend Website <no-reply@your-domain>`; the domain must be verified in Resend |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Production | Public origin used for canonical URLs, hreflang, `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt` and Open Graph. Default `https://www.megatrend.vn` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ENABLED` | No | `true` turns on the analytics slot (`components/layout/Analytics.tsx`), which still waits for "Accept all" in the cookie banner |
| `SITE_NOINDEX` | Test deployments | `true` at build time sends `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` on every response. Leave unset on the real site |

## Project structure

```text
app/[locale]/          routes only (thin): pages, layout, not-found
app/api/contact/       contact form endpoint (validation, honeypot, rate limit, email)
app/sitemap.ts, robots.ts, globals.css (design tokens), icon.png
components/ui/         Button, Card, Chip, Container, Section, Reveal (know nothing about content)
components/sections/   Hero, SolutionGrid, ProjectGrid, FeaturedProjects, CtaBand, PageHeader, MdxContent, ContactForm, LegalPage…
components/layout/     Header, Footer, LanguageSwitcher, CookieBanner, Analytics
content/               all editable content (see below)
lib/content.ts         Zod schemas + readers: the only code that reads /content
lib/i18n/  lib/seo/  lib/email/  lib/contact.ts  lib/rate-limit.ts  lib/consent.ts
messages/              en.json, vi.json: UI strings (buttons, labels, form errors)
public/images/         imported photos and logos; public/placeholders/ generated placeholders
scripts/               optimize-images.mjs, check-content.ts
tests/e2e/             Playwright smoke tests
site.config.ts         brand name, menu, contact details, social links, locales
```

Dependencies flow one way: `components/ui` → `components/sections` → `app/[locale]`.

## Where to change what

| Task | Where | Code change? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add or edit a Solution, Project, Segment, News item or Job | `content/<type>/<slug>/en.mdx` and `vi.mdx`; photos in `public/images/` | No |
| Edit home, about, privacy or cookie page text | `content/pages/<slug>/en.mdx` and `vi.mdx` | No |
| Add or edit a partner | `content/partners.json`; logo in `public/images/partners/` | No |
| Change UI text (buttons, labels, form errors) | `messages/en.json` and `messages/vi.json` (same keys in both) | No |
| Change company name, menu, contact details, social links | `site.config.ts` | No |
| Change colours, font, spacing | Design tokens at the top of `app/globals.css` | One place |
| Add a language | `locales` in `site.config.ts`, `messages/<code>.json`, a `<code>.mdx` per record | Little |
| Add a content type | Schema in `lib/content.ts`, `content/<type>/`, routes in `app/[locale]/` | Yes |
| Add a home page block | Component in `components/sections/`, used in `app/[locale]/page.tsx` | Yes |

A record without a `vi.mdx` falls back to `en.mdx` and shows a short notice. `en.mdx` is required.

## Adding a new Solution

1. Create `content/solutions/<slug>/` (kebab-case slug, e.g. `wifi-design`).
2. Add `en.mdx`:

   ```mdx
   ---
   slug: "wifi-design"              # must equal the folder name
   title: "Wi-Fi design"
   tagline: "One line shown on cards"
   summary: "One or two sentences for the detail page and search engines"
   icon: "network"                  # shown on cards; names are listed in lib/tech-icons.ts
   image:                           # shown on the detail page
     src: "/images/solutions/wifi-design.webp"
     alt: "Describe the photo"
   features: ["Feature 1", "Feature 2"]         # optional
   relatedProjects: ["amanoi-resort"]           # optional, project slugs
   order: 10                                    # optional, position in lists
   ---

   ## Overview

   Body in Markdown/MDX.
   ```

3. Add `vi.mdx` with the same fields translated (keep `slug`, `relatedProjects` and `order` identical).
4. Put the photo in `public/images/solutions/` and run `npm run images:optimize`.
5. To show it in a segment, add the slug to `solutions:` in `content/segments/<segment>/*.mdx`.
6. Run `npm run content:check`, then open `/en/solutions/<slug>` and `/vi/solutions/<slug>` with `npm run dev`.

The solution then appears automatically on the home page grid (first six by `order`), `/solutions`, the sitemaps and related pages.

## Update workflow

1. Create a git branch for the change.
2. Open a pull request: CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm run check`, `npm run build` and the Playwright tests; Vercel builds a preview.
3. Check the preview in both `/en` and `/vi`, then merge into `main` to deploy to production.
4. Every quarter: `npm outdated`, upgrade, then `npm run check` and `npm run build` again.

If editors will not use git, replace the readers in `lib/content.ts` with a headless CMS client (Sanity, Payload or Strapi) and keep its exported functions; routes and components do not change.

## Deploying to Vercel

Deployed to the Vercel project `megatrend` (team `dragonbeard-devs-projects`) with `npx vercel --prod`:
https://megatrend-ruby.vercel.app. The project is not yet connected to this GitHub repository, so pushes do not deploy.
Set the environment variables above for Production and Preview.

### Domain and DNS

`megatrend.vn` and `www.megatrend.vn` are added to the Vercel project. Add these records at the domain's DNS provider:

| Host | Type | Value | TTL |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@` | A | `216.198.79.1` | 3600 |
| `@` | A | `64.29.17.1` | 3600 |
| `www` | CNAME | `a5c3dfc2d991aa9d.vercel-dns-017.com.` | 3600 |

Alternative: point the domain's nameservers to `ns1.vercel-dns.com` and `ns2.vercel-dns.com` and let Vercel manage DNS.
Do not change existing `MX` records (email). Check with `npx vercel domains verify megatrend.vn`; Vercel issues HTTPS automatically once DNS is correct.

## Lighthouse (mobile, home page)

Measured locally on a production build (`next build && next start`, Lighthouse 12.8.2, mobile preset, Chrome 155 headless),
built with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3200` so the canonical URL matched the audited host:

| Page | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/en` | 93 / 92 | 100 | 100 | 100 |
| `/vi` | 91 / 91 | 100 | 100 | 100 |

Two runs each. Performance has a small margin; LCP is the hero photo (about 3.2–3.4 s under simulated slow 4G), CLS is 0–0.001.
Real numbers on Vercel will differ; re-check after deploying with PageSpeed Insights.

Re-measured on 2026-11-02 after adding the hero slideshow and real content, `/vi`, three alternating runs on one machine:
Performance 67–87 (LCP 3.9–4.5 s), against 79–83 (LCP 4.5–5.0 s) for the previous commit under the same conditions.
Both are below the earlier table, so the difference comes from the measuring conditions rather than the slideshow, but the 90 target is not
confirmed on this machine. Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO were 100 on `/en` and `/vi`. Re-check on the deployed site.

## Libraries

| Package | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `next`, `react`, `react-dom` | Framework: App Router, static generation, route handlers |
| `tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/turbopack` | Styling with design tokens; Turbopack CSS loader generated by create-next-app |
| `next-intl` | Locale routing (`/en`, `/vi`), UI string catalogs in `messages/*.json` |
| `zod` | Schemas for content frontmatter and the contact form (client and server) |
| `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers` | Contact form state and Zod validation on the client. Resolvers pinned to v5: v6 has an unresolvable optional peer (`effect@4`) with npm |
| `resend` | Sends contact-form leads by email |
| `gray-matter` | Parses MDX frontmatter in `lib/content.ts` |
| `next-mdx-remote` | Renders MDX bodies from `/content` in Server Components |
| `remark-gfm` | Markdown tables in MDX (used by the cookie policy) |
| `sharp` (dev) | `scripts/optimize-images.mjs`: resize and convert photos to WebP |
| `@playwright/test` (dev) | Smoke tests and layout screenshots |
| `tsx` (dev) | Runs `scripts/check-content.ts`, which reuses `lib/content.ts` (TypeScript with `@/` path aliases) |

## Assumptions

- **Next.js 16.4 without Cache Components.** create-next-app enabled `cacheComponents` and `partialPrefetching`; both were removed.
  Every content page is statically generated with `generateStaticParams`, which is what the brief asks for and works with `next-intl` without extra wiring.
- **Proxy instead of middleware.** Next 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`; locale detection and the `/` → `/en` redirect live there.
- **Legacy assets.** The legacy repo was at commit `a71ae97` (matches the brief), file counts matched the brief.
  Only `public/` was extracted (`git archive`), because the full checkout fails on Windows path-length limits in folders we do not use anyway.
- **Image folders are flat per type** (`public/images/projects/…`), as in the Assets table of the brief, rather than one folder per record:
  several records share photos, and the legacy photos are not tied to specific records.
- **Logo colours.** The Megatrend logo uses navy and a blue-to-cyan gradient, slightly different from `#0f5bff`.
  The brief's palette was kept unchanged; the logo is used as-is. `megatrend-logo-full.png` had its transparent padding trimmed (no visual change).
- **Muted text on tinted backgrounds** uses `#5a6d88` (token `--text-muted-on-tint`) instead of `#61748e`, to stay at or above 4.5:1.
- **Contact details** in `site.config.ts` come from the 2026 company profile. Social links are empty because no company profiles were provided; the footer column appears once entries are added.
- **Favicon** (`app/icon.png`) is generated from `megatrend-logo-icon.png`; the Open Graph image `megatrend-og-default.png` (1200×630)
  is generated from `megatrend-logo-full.png` on the `--brand-soft` background.
- **Extra content type `pages`** (`content/pages/{home,about,privacy-policy,cookies}`) holds long text for those pages, so no page copy is hard-coded.
- **Content replaces the brief's placeholders, on the owner's instruction** (2026-11-02). Projects, partners and figures come from the
  2026 company profile and www.megatrend.vn. Technology explanations are general knowledge. These items are drafted and need confirming:
  the three service packages, the two job openings, the news publication dates (the date of the post, not of the event), and the values text.
- **Project photos.** Only Panoma, Amanoi, Casamia and Novotel use images from the company profile. The other 12 covers are photos from the
  legacy library chosen by building type; they may not show that property.
- **Solutions and packages show icons** (`components/ui/TechIcon.tsx`, hand-drawn SVG, no new dependency); real photos appear on the detail pages.
- **Hero slideshow** rotates every 6 seconds, and has pause and per-photo controls. It does not start on its own under `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Home hero headline** follows the company profile's positioning (ICT, ELV, Smart Building and hospitality).
- **Partners page** has two blocks, set by `group` in `content/partners.json` and matching the company profile: 8 hotel groups as clients (page 4) and 24 technology vendors as partners (page 5).
  Logos cropped from the profile are low resolution; replace them with official files when available.
- **Font**: Be Vietnam Pro (Latin + Vietnamese) with weights 400, 500 and 700, not preloaded, to keep the mobile LCP under budget;
  `font-semibold`/`font-extrabold` render with the 700 file.
- **Images**: `images.qualities` is `[60, 75]`; the hero uses 60 because it sits under a dark overlay.
- **Client messages**: only the `nav`, `header`, `language`, `cookie` and `form` namespaces are sent to the browser.
- **Dates** are formatted in the `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` time zone.
- **Smoke tests run against `next dev`**, because the brief requires the "log instead of send" behaviour only in development.
  The production build is verified separately by `npm run build` (CI runs both).
- **Contact form**: phone accepts digits, spaces, `+ ( ) . -` (6–20 characters); message 10–2,000 characters; the honeypot field is `website`.

## Known limitations

- **Contact rate limit is in memory** (`lib/rate-limit.ts`, 5 requests per IP per 10 minutes). Each server instance keeps its own counter,
  so on Vercel (several instances, cold starts) the limit is best-effort. For a strict limit, move the counter to a shared store such as Upstash Redis.
- **No CAPTCHA** in this version (per the brief); spam protection is the honeypot field plus the rate limit.
- **Analytics slot is empty**: `components/layout/Analytics.tsx` renders nothing until a provider is added. Changing consent from
  "Accept all" back to "Essential only" will need a page reload (or explicit teardown) once a provider script is added; consent changes
  are not synced across open tabs.
- **No Content-Security-Policy or other security headers** are configured yet; add them in `next.config.ts` (`headers()`) once the
  analytics provider and final domains are known.
- **Rate-limit key**: the client IP comes from `x-real-ip` (set by Vercel) or the first `X-Forwarded-For` entry, validated as an IP.
  Behind another proxy that does not overwrite these headers, a client could spoof them; configure the proxy accordingly.
- **Legal pages are templates** and show a "needs legal review" notice on the page.
- **Dev server caches optimized images** (`.next/cache/images`, 4-hour TTL in Next 16): after replacing an image file under the
  same name, delete that folder or rename the file to see the change locally.

## Needs a person before going live

- Resend: create the account, verify the sending domain, set `RESEND_API_KEY` and `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL`.
- Domain: buy/configure it and set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
- Legal: have counsel review the privacy and cookie policies; confirm the company's legal name.
- Rights: confirm the right to use every partner and hotel logo, and photos that show hotel brands, including the images taken from the company profile.
- Content: confirm the items listed under Assumptions, add social links, and replace generic project covers with real photos.

## Assets

Imported from the legacy repo `letatkhoa3000/networkai-full` (commit `a71ae97`, `public/` only), de-duplicated by MD5,
renamed to kebab-case and optimized with `npm run images:optimize` (WebP, max 1920 px, under 300 KB; SVG and PNG logos untouched).
Alt text in both languages lives with the content that uses the image (see `content/`); the table below is the reference copy.

> Partner and hotel logos, and photos showing hotel brands, are third-party trademarks. The company must confirm the right to use them before going live.

The glass tower is the cover photo of the 2026 company profile; its original license is unknown, so the company should confirm it.

The About page photo `public/images/about/knx-lighting-control-panel.webp` comes from a
[LinkedIn post by Mouhamad Kassem EL-Mourad](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mouhamad-kassem-el-mourad-a2a60a26a_a-knx-lighting-control-system-panel-is-essentially-activity-7456559491950702592-NJvS), used at the owner's request (2026-11-04). No license is stated, so get permission or replace it before going live.
The About page uses `public/images/home/technicians-installing-rack.webp` (the team on site), and `.vercelignore` keeps the KNX file out of deployments. To use it instead, point `hero.image` in `content/pages/about/{en,vi}.mdx` at the file, remove it from `.vercelignore` and update the About test in `tests/e2e/pages.spec.ts`.

The "Planned use" column records the original sample assignment; `content/` is now the source of truth for where a photo is used.
`panoma-penthouse-b4-2.webp`, `amanoi-resort-hillside.webp`, `hilton-tapestry-casamia-render.webp` and `novotel-naman-village.webp` come from the
2026 company profile. Panoma (600 px) and Novotel (400 px) are low resolution and look soft at full width; replace them with originals.
